# MÃ³dulo 3 - AWS Global Infrastructure

A AWS Region is a geographic location and usualy consists of two or more Avaliability Zones.

We should consider a few factors when selecting a Region:
- Legal requirements (laws)
- Proximity with customers (latency)
- Availble services for the region
- Costs (it may vary from Region to Region)

### Availability Zone
Each Region has multiple AZs
Avaliabilty Zones consists of multiple distincts Data Centers
Are projected for isolating failures and are interconected to other avaliability zones.

### Presence Points
Amazon CloudFront is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) used to distribute content to end user at a low latency.
Amazon Route 53 is a DNS (Domain Name Service) that routes any requests to the nearest presence point
Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches improve performance by caching content in locations closer to users.
