# 📚 Study Notes Repository

Welcome!  
This repository is my personal knowledge vault — a collection of notes, summaries, diagrams, and resources from all my studies across different technologies and subjects.

It currently contains:

- **AWS Cloud Foundations** (AWS Academy)
- **AWS Cloud Developer** *(upcoming)*
- **React** *(upcoming)*
- **Spring Boot** *(upcoming)*

---

## 📂 Structure

- `aws/` → AWS-related notes, organized by course.
- `react/` → React.js and related frontend topics.
- `spring-boot/` → Spring Boot and backend development notes.

Each topic folder contains:
- A dedicated `README.md` with an overview.
- Markdown files with notes.
- Images or diagrams used in the notes.

---

## 📝 Conventions

- **Markdown formatting** for clarity.
- One folder per subject.
- Course notes are split into `module-01.md`, `module-02.md`, etc.
- All images go into an `images/` folder inside the course directory.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Keep study notes well-structured and version-controlled.
- Build a reusable and searchable reference library for future projects and certifications.
